# MiniDisco - A Bandcamp Downloader
Utility to automate the bulk downloading of __purchased albums__ from the Bandcamp website.

The script drives a web browser with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to 
log into Bandcamp, go to the account collection, find all of the "New" albums and
download each one. The cover art/album art is also downloaded.

It automates the process you have to manually go through to download purchased music. 

I often purchase over 10 album at a time and downloading them manually is tedious so
I wrote this Python script.
